We followed the setup from whisper finetuning event for performing the ASR finetuning experiments with child speech. The training and finetuning details for replicating our experiments can be followed from the following link: https://github.com/huggingface/community-events/tree/main/whisper-fine-tuning-event

We also provide a more comprehensive understanding of the hyperparameter settings and training details for all our experiments on our Hugging Face repository which is accessible at https://huggingface.co/rishabhjain16
